SWRSharp is a C# Mud server.

It is currently in a very early state with barely any funtionality.

Currently the server will accept connections, allow users to create characters and log in.  A very basic command Interpreter has been implemented with basic movement commands, look, quit and shutdown. Area files have been implemented to define the world, so far only rooms and exits are included.

This code may be used freely in open source projects so long as credit is given to the original Author.
